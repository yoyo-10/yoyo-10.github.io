* Lab 6

    Lab 6, Part 1. This is one of my favorite lab. In this lab assignment, I am able to tell the size of command line. Also, I know if I want to count the place of command line, I should start from 0.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, Part 2. In this lab, I know about how the black jack works. The function can help me calculate the value of cards we get. It also make me think about the best strategy for us to win the black jack.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, Part 1. With the use of if function to decide if they can park or not. I tried to write down all of the conditions that match the parking rules, it takes long time. However, I can just write down the conditions which do “not” fit the rules.
